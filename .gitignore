Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique in natural language processing that combines generative models (like GPT) with a retrieval mechanism to enhance the quality and accuracy of generated responses. When applying RAG to Excel data, the goal is to use the information contained in Excel files to improve the context and relevance of the generated responses.
